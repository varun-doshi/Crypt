# Welcome to CRYPT
## Save your Medical History permanently to your "Soul"

[View the project here.](https://varun-doshi.github.io/Crypt/)

### Crypt uses the power of Blockchain and permanent storage to provide users an efficient and reliable way to store their data. 
## How the app works:
* Get your check-ups completed at your nearest Medical center.
* Provide your Wallet Address once completed.
* An Soulbound Token(SBT) will be minted to your address. This SBT will be your Medical Report holding all the results of your tests.
* SBTs cannot be transferred and hence removes the threat of theft.
* Your data is tored on the Filecoin servers using nft.storage service. Filecoin provides Provable Permanent Storage so we ensure you will never loose your data.
* SBTs are minted on Polygon network which ensures cheap and fast transactions.
* You can now view your Files from the app itself.

### Technologies used: Solidity, Polygon, Filecoin, IPFS, React Js, TailwindCSS, Node Js




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
